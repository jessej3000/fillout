# Overview
Hello and welcome to my test. I am Jesse Junsay, a software developer. And I came accross this opportunity in linkedin. And so I applied. And this is my answer to the code challenge.

# Tech stack
I tried to follow as much as I can on what technology to use.

- Express - for the api
- Typescript - code
- Jest - for unit test
- Git - code repo (git@github.com:jessej3000/fillout.git)
- Render - to host my service
- Yarn - for package management

# Getting started
1. Clone or download the code git@github.com:jessej3000/fillout.git
2. Install using "Yarn install". If you have no yarn, here is a quick help: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable
3. "yarn build" - to build the project.
4. "yarn start" - to run the project. The service should be running in port 3000.
5. To run unit tesst just run "yarn test"

# Room for improvement
1. Can add more test cases specially in the middleware
2. Can also add e2e test
